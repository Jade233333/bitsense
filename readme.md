# bitsense

This is a game for me or anyone to practice bin and hex conversion speed. It helps in computing exams if one has a good intuition with it. Also I see it as a good chance to practice TUI as I use tools with TUI everyday but don't know how to write one. I may also make a WebUI version as it is also a good game to compete with friends.
