### Big pictures

A game and practice tool to help CS CompE student get a sense of bits. By which I mean to make students comfortable with binary and hex conversion.

### Description

The game or the tools should at least include the following modes, bin2hex, hex2bin, typing speed, ascii to bin, ascii to hex, bin to ascii and hex to ascii. We could include more and more different mode if we wanted to, including moorse code or any other code that requrie users to acquire a fast intuition about conversion between two different representation. I would say that even pinyin is possible to include. So as a result, I would like to make the project as modular as possbile. Probaly I will start with a pure typing test.

Forgot to mention, despite different conversion mode we should also include different playing mode, including training, limited time, limited bits. I will start with limited time like one minutes, but I will make it as modular as possible while working on it.

After the typing part, another big problem to solve about the project is history data. I want a visiualization just like monkeytype stats. It shows instant speed at sampling points and has a line graph showing it changes as time.

Last thing is about the theme, how do I want it to look. Monkeytype has quite a good minimalistic look and it is very configurable. How did it do it? I might do the similar things. Is it even possible to just fork it. I would perfer not to. As I do not want it to be too fancy, and has lots of features I do not understand. I am not familiar with css, js, and html, so I should use it a chance to start and get familiar with it.

In the end, I want to make it simple and minimalistic. That is the standard I choose a tool now, so I will make one by this standard.

### Progress

Key point is about configurable and modular. Maybe I should start with input and output.
The input is simple, the users keystroke. For output, after each stroke we need to verify the correctness and give different feedback on that. And in the end, we have stats and feedback about each session including speed and correctness.

We probaly need the following status related to input

1. Conversion mode selection
2. Playing mode selection
3. Key stroke input
4. timer

And before going to the output, we probaly need following process to raw input

1. answer sheet generated by conversion mode
2. nothing from playing mode that would probaly just be different starting and ending signal
3. instant keystroke to compare with answer sheet
4. keystroke per # sec to calculate speed

To be specific, for the keystroke, we can use a separate file per game to record raw keystroke. And every # sec, we add a line break in that file. But the problem is how to deal with deletion of any char, if it is within the line, there are no problem, but if its a new line, it will delete the line break. What about only record correct keystroke. That will solve the problem but also lose raw data to calc correct ness. what about record every keystroke and time stamp in single file and later process it. For And control signal from playing mode selection to store. And instant correct ness showing is based on a completely different logic. Does not seem to be efficient.

What about use answer sheet as the filter, only record the key if it is correct and record a symble for error for wrong stroke. Then a better idea could be a bit mask file for correct ness and a file for raw keystroke. That make sense, and it is modular enough for more advanced stats like which two key mixed up the most. What about the timer. it could be another file checking correct the size of bit musk file every # sec and record the length. For all, and for only ones can tell the speed of raw keystroke and correct speed.
